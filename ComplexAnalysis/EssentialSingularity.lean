# Isolated essential singularities and Casorati–Weierstrass

A function holomorphic on a punctured neighborhood has a removable singularity, a pole,
or an essential singularity. Meromorphic germs are exactly those admitting a finite limit
or tending to infinity in norm. At a nonmeromorphic isolated holomorphic singularity,
the image of every punctured neighborhood is dense in the complex plane.

The assigned value at the singular point is irrelevant throughout. Removability is expressed
by an analytic germ agreeing with the function on a punctured neighborhood.
