# Subharmonic functions of one complex variable

A real-valued function on an open subset of `ℂ` is subharmonic if it is upper semicontinuous and
satisfies the local submean inequality: at every point, for all sufficiently small radii the
function is integrable on the circle and its value at the center is at most its circle average.
This is the definition of [Ransford][Ransford1995], *Potential Theory in the Complex Plane*,
Definition 2.2.1, and of [Fritzsche–Grauert][FritzscheGrauert2002], Chapter II, Section 2, with
the harmonic-majorant condition replaced by the submean inequality. Locality is then immediate.
The submean inequality on every closed disc in the domain and the plurisubharmonic theory are
developed in later files.

Only real-valued functions are considered; the value `-∞` is not admitted.

This file proves closure under sums, nonnegative multiples and maxima, gives the holomorphic
examples (real parts, positive powers of norms, logarithms of nonvanishing moduli), and proves
the maximum principle: a subharmonic function on a preconnected open set that attains its
supremum is constant. On a disc, if it is upper semicontinuous on the closed disc, it is
bounded by its supremum on the boundary circle.

## Main definitions

* `HasSubmeanAt`: The local submean property at a point: for every sufficiently small radius, the
  function is integrable on the circle and its value at the center is bounded by its circle average.
* `SubharmonicOn`: A real function is subharmonic on a set if it is upper semicontinuous there and
  has the local submean property at each of its points.

## Main results

* `SubharmonicOn.eqOn_const_of_isMaxOn`: **Maximum principle.** A subharmonic function on a
  preconnected open set that attains its supremum at a point is constant.
* `SubharmonicOn.le_of_le_sphere`: **Maximum principle on a disc.** A function subharmonic on an
  open disc and upper semicontinuous on the closed disc is bounded by any bound valid on the
  boundary circle.
