# Harmonic polynomial majorants and the submean inequality

Real parts of complex polynomials in `(z - a) / r` are harmonic and approximate every continuous
function on the circle of radius `r` about `a` uniformly, by density of trigonometric
polynomials. Consequently a continuous function satisfies the submean inequality on a closed
disc as soon as it lies below the center value of every such harmonic polynomial that dominates
it on the boundary circle.

Combined with the maximum principle on discs, this gives the submean inequality on every closed
disc in the domain for continuous subharmonic functions, whose definition only asks for the
inequality on small circles.

## Main results

* `le_circleAverage_of_forall_polynomial_majorant`: **Harmonic-majorant criterion.** A function
  continuous on a circle whose center value is dominated by the center value of every harmonic
  polynomial majorant on the circle satisfies the submean inequality.
* `SubharmonicOn.le_circleAverage_of_continuousOn`: **Submean inequality on closed discs.** A
  continuous subharmonic function satisfies the submean inequality on every closed disc contained in
  its domain.
