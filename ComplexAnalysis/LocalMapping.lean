# The local mapping theorem

If `f` is analytic at `a` and `f - f a` vanishes to order `m ≥ 1` at `a`, then `f` is locally
`m`-to-one near `a`: for every small `ε` there is `δ > 0` such that every value `w` with
`0 < ‖w - f a‖ < δ` is taken exactly `m` times in `ball a ε`, each time with nonzero derivative.
The proof is Rouché's theorem: the divisor degrees of `f - w` and `f - f a` on the closed disc
agree, the latter is `m`, and the zeros of `f - w` are simple because `deriv f` does not vanish
on a punctured neighborhood of `a`.

## Main results

* `Complex.eventually_ne_and_deriv_ne_zero`: `f - f a` and `deriv f` vanish nowhere on a
  punctured neighborhood of `a` when the order is finite.
* `Complex.exists_forall_ncard_preimage_eq`: **the local mapping theorem**.
