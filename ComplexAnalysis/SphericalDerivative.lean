# The spherical derivative

The spherical derivative `f#(z) = |f'(z)| / (1 + |f(z)|²)` of a holomorphic function measures
the local distortion of the chordal metric (`ChordalMetric.lean`) under `f`: it is the
infinitesimal ratio of chordal length in the target to Euclidean length in the source,
`f#(z) = lim_{w → z} chordalDist (f w) (f z) / ‖w - z‖` (this limit characterization is not
proved here). Unlike the ordinary derivative, the spherical derivative is unchanged under
post-composition with the inversion `w ↦ 1/w`, reflecting that inversion is a chordal isometry
of the sphere — this is the one structural property proved in this file.

## Main definitions

* `Complex.sphericalDeriv f z = ‖deriv f z‖ / (1 + ‖f z‖ ^ 2)`.

## Main results

* `Complex.sphericalDeriv_nonneg`.
* `Complex.sphericalDeriv_inv`: the spherical derivative of `1 / f` agrees with that of `f`
  wherever `f` is differentiable and nonzero.
