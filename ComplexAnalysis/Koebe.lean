# Bieberbach's coefficient bound and the Koebe one-quarter theorem

Let `f` be holomorphic and injective on the unit disc with `f 0 = 0` and `f' 0 = 1` (the class
`S`), and write `f z = z + a₂ z² + ⋯`. **Bieberbach's theorem** states `‖a₂‖ ≤ 2`: the square-root
transform `F z = z √(f (z²) / z²)` is odd, injective and normalized, so `1 / F` belongs to the
class `Σ` of the area theorem with first coefficient `-a₂ / 2`, and the area theorem gives
`‖a₂ / 2‖ ≤ 1`. **The Koebe one-quarter theorem** follows: if `w` is omitted by `f`, the
function `f / (1 - f / w)` is again in the class `S` with second coefficient `a₂ + 1 / w`, so
`‖1 / w‖ ≤ 4`. Hence the image of the unit disc contains the disc of radius `1 / 4`.

## Main results

* `Complex.norm_taylorCoeff_two_le`: **Bieberbach's theorem** `‖a₂‖ ≤ 2`.
* `Complex.norm_iteratedDeriv_two_le`: the same bound as `‖f'' 0‖ ≤ 4`.
* `Complex.ball_subset_image_of_injOn`: **the Koebe one-quarter theorem**.
