# Analytic continuation along paths

An analytic continuation along a continuous path `γ : I → ℂ` is a family of function elements
`(f t, ball (γ t) (r t))`, `f t` analytic on the disc, such that for `s` close to `t` the point
`γ s` lies in the disc of `t` and the elements `f s` and `f t` agree near `γ s`. The main result
is the **uniqueness of analytic continuation**: two continuations along the same path with the
same germ at the initial point have the same germ at the end point. The proof shows that the set
of parameters where the germs agree is clopen in the connected unit interval, using the identity
theorem on the discs.

## Main definitions

* `Complex.IsContinuationAlong γ f r`.

## Main results

* `Complex.IsContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq_one_of_eventuallyEq_zero`: uniqueness of the
  continuation along a path.
* `Complex.IsContinuationAlong.eventuallyEq_of_eventuallyEq`: the germs agree at every
  parameter.
