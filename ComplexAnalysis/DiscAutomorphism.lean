# Automorphisms of the unit disc

Every holomorphic bijection of the unit disc onto itself has the form `z ↦ c * φ_a z` with
`‖c‖ = 1` and `‖a‖ < 1`, where `φ_a` is the disc Möbius transformation
(`Complex.discMobius`). The proof is the Schwarz lemma applied to the map and its inverse
after normalizing the fixed point to `0`. As a consequence the normalized Riemann map is
unique.

## Main results

* `Complex.exists_eqOn_mul_of_leftInverse_of_map_zero`: an automorphism fixing `0` is a
  rotation.
* `Complex.exists_eqOn_mul_discMobius_of_leftInverse`,
  `Complex.exists_eqOn_mul_discMobius_of_injOn_of_image_eq`: the classification.
* `Complex.eqOn_of_riemannMap`: uniqueness of the normalized Riemann map.
