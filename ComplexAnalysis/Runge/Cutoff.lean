# Smooth cutoffs and the Cauchy–Pompeiu representation of holomorphic functions

A holomorphic function `f` on an open set `U` is represented on a compact subset `K` by a
Cauchy-type integral `f z = ∫ w in Ω, g w * (w - z)⁻¹` whose density `g` is continuous and
supported in a compact set `Ω ⊆ U \ K`: with a smooth cutoff `φ` equal to `1` near `K` and
compactly supported in `U`, the Cauchy–Pompeiu identity applied to the translates of `φ f` gives
`g = -π⁻¹ f ∂φ/∂z̄`. This is the representation used in the proof of Runge's theorem that avoids
contour constructions (Hörmander 1.4.4; Rudin, *Real and Complex Analysis*, 13.6 uses a cycle
instead).

## Main results

* `Complex.exists_smooth_cutoff`: a `C¹` cutoff equal to `1` near a compact set and compactly
  supported in a given open neighborhood.
* `Complex.exists_cauchyPompeiu_representation`: the representation of a holomorphic function
  on a compact set by a Cauchy-type integral with continuous density supported off the set.
