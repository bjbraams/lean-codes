# Runge's theorem: approximation by sums of simple poles off a compact set

A function holomorphic on an open neighborhood `U` of a compact set `K` is, uniformly on `K`,
a limit of finite sums of simple poles `∑ i, a i * (c i - z)⁻¹` with poles `c i ∈ U \ K`. The
proof combines the Cauchy–Pompeiu representation of `f` on `K` by a Cauchy-type integral with
continuous density supported in `U \ K` and the uniform approximation of such integrals by finite
pole sums.

Moving the poles into prescribed components of the complement of `K`, and replacing the poles
in the unbounded component by polynomials, is the pole-pushing step of Runge's theorem, which
is developed separately.
