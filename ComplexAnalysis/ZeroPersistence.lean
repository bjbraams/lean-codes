# Persistence of zeros in holomorphic families

A zero inside a disc persists under small continuous changes of a holomorphic function, provided
the original function has no zeros on the boundary. The proof uses the maximum modulus principle
for the reciprocal of a hypothetically nonvanishing perturbation; no root counting is required.

## Main results

`exists_zero_of_norm_lt_boundary` persists a zero inside a disc under a small perturbation with
no boundary zeros. `eventually_exists_zero_in_fiber` is persistence of zeros in a holomorphic
family.
