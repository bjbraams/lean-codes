# Separation by holomorphic disk boundaries

For an injective holomorphic map on a disk, the image of a smaller concentric circle
separates the plane into precisely its image disk and the complement of its image
closed disk. The exterior is connected because the larger image disk supplies a
connected outer annulus. This proves separation for this class of analytic contours,
without invoking the Jordan theorem for arbitrary embedded circles.
