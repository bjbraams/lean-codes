# Complex powers on the positive half-line

The function `positiveCpow` equals the principal complex power on the positive real half-line
and is extended by zero on the nonpositive half-line. Continuity across zero requires a positive
real part of the exponent; differentiability across zero requires real part greater than one.
The Gamma-normalized version shifts the exponent by one and satisfies a parameter-lowering
derivative formula under the corresponding stronger bound.

## Main results

* `Complex.continuous_positiveCpow`: The positive-axis complex power is continuous when the
  exponent has positive real part.
* `Complex.hasDerivAt_positiveCpow`: The positive-axis complex power has the expected derivative
  when the exponent has real part greater than one.
* `Complex.continuous_positiveGammaPower`: The Gamma-normalized positive-axis power is
  continuous when the exponent has real part greater than one.
* `Complex.hasDerivAt_positiveGammaPower`: Differentiating the Gamma-normalized positive-axis
  power lowers its exponent by one.
