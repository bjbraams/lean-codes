# Local zero sets as graphs

The implicit mapping theorem supplies a homeomorphism from a regular local zero set to the
parameter neighborhood. This is an elementary statement about subsets of product spaces, without
a manifold or analytic-space structure. Reference: [Scheidemann][Scheidemann2005] (2005),
Corollary 3.1.5.

## Main results

`Homeomorph.implicitGraph` is the local graph homeomorphism of a regular zero set in a product.
`exists_implicit_zero_homeomorph` packages existence of that homeomorphism from the implicit
mapping theorem.
