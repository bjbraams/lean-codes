# Runge pairs, Runge domains and polynomial hulls

A pair of sets `U ⊆ V` is a Runge pair if every holomorphic function on `U` is a locally uniform
limit of holomorphic functions on `V`; an open subset of `ℂⁿ` is a Runge domain if every
holomorphic function on it is a locally uniform limit of polynomials. Both notions are stated
through approximation within `ε` on compact subsets, and for open sets this is shown equivalent
to convergence of a sequence locally uniformly.

The polynomial hull of a compact set is the set of points where every polynomial is bounded by
its supremum on the set; it agrees with the hull relative to all entire functions, because
entire functions are locally uniform limits of their Taylor polynomials. Consequently a set is a
Runge domain exactly when it forms a Runge pair with the whole space.

For a Runge domain `U`, the polynomial hull of a compact `K ⊆ U` meets `U` in the holomorphic
hull of `K` relative to `U`, and for a Runge domain of holomorphy this set is compact. These are
the elementary implications of the hull characterization of Runge domains
([Hörmander][Hormander1973], Theorem 2.7.3; [Jakóbczak–Jarnicki][JakobczakJarnicki2021], Theorem
4.3.3). The converse implications constitute the Oka–Weil theorem and are not included.

## Main definitions

* `polynomialHull`: The polynomial hull of a set: the points at which every polynomial is bounded by
  each of its bounds on the set.
* `IsPolynomiallyConvex`: A set is polynomially convex if it equals its polynomial hull.
* `IsRungePair`: A **Runge pair**: `U ⊆ V`, and every holomorphic function on `U` is approximated
  within `ε` on every compact subset of `U` by a holomorphic function on `V`.
* `IsRungeDomain`: A **Runge domain** in `ℂⁿ`: every holomorphic function is approximated within `ε`
  on every compact subset by a polynomial.

## Main results

* `exists_mvPolynomial_approx_of_entire`: **Entire functions are locally uniform limits of
  polynomials.** On a compact set, an entire function is approximated within `ε` by a Taylor
  polynomial.
* `polynomialHull_eq_holomorphicHull_univ`: **Polynomial and entire hulls agree** on compact sets,
  since entire functions are locally uniform limits of polynomials.
* `IsRungeDomain.polynomialHull_inter`: **Hull identity for Runge domains.** For a Runge domain `U`
  and a compact `K ⊆ U`, the polynomial hull of `K` meets `U` exactly in the holomorphic hull of `K`
  relative to `U`.
* `IsRungePair.exists_seq_tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn`: **Sequence formulation.** For an open `U`, a
  Runge pair provides, for each holomorphic function on `U`, a sequence of holomorphic functions on
  `V` converging locally uniformly.
