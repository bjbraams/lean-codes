# Elementary factorization of analytic germs

[Jakóbczak–Jarnicki][JakobczakJarnicki2021], Proposition 1.8.4: scalar analytic germ rings in
finite dimension are unique factorization domains. The analytic ingredient is that an
irreducible germ is prime. Together with Noetherianity this supplies Mathlib's
`UniqueFactorizationMonoid` instance and its usual existence and uniqueness results.

The source's “relatively prime” is expressed as `IsRelPrime`, meaning that common divisors are
units. It is not `IsCoprime`: two germs vanishing at the base point cannot generate the unit
ideal. No geometric conclusions from §1.8.5 are included.

## Main results

* `prime_of_irreducible`: Irreducible analytic germs are prime in finite dimension: transport to the
  origin of a coordinate presentation using the induction on dimension above.
* `exists_prime_factors`: Every nonzero analytic germ is associated to a finite product of prime
  germs.
* `factors_unique`: Irreducible factorizations agree up to reordering and multiplication by units.
* `isRelPrime_iff_common_divisors`: Relative primality of germs means that every common divisor is a
  unit.
* `not_isCoprime_of_eval_eq_zero`: Two germs vanishing at the base point cannot generate the unit
  ideal.
