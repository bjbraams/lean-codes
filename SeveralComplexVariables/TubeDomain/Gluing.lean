# Gluing local analytic continuations along a convex set

Let `g` be holomorphic on an open set `U` of a complex normed space and let `L ⊆ U` be convex.
Suppose that at every point `ζ` of `L` there is a holomorphic function on the ball of radius `δ`
around `ζ` agreeing with `g` near `ζ`. Then these local continuations agree on overlaps and
define a holomorphic function on the `δ`-neighborhood of `L` agreeing with `g` near every point
of `L`. The overlap argument passes through the midpoint of two centers, which lies in `L` and
in both balls, and uses the identity theorem on a thickened segment.

## Main results

* `eventuallyEq_of_isPreconnected`: **Propagation of local agreement along a preconnected set.** Two
  holomorphic functions on an open set that agree near one point of a preconnected subset agree near
  every point of that subset.
* `exists_glue_of_local_continuations`: **Gluing lemma.** Local holomorphic continuations of `g` on
  balls of a fixed radius around the points of a convex set `L ⊆ U` glue to a holomorphic function
  on the `δ`-neighborhood of `L` agreeing with `g` near every point of `L`.
