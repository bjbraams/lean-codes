# Reconstruction of polynomials from finite coefficient vectors

The notation `R[X]` denotes `Polynomial R`. Mathlib's linear map `Polynomial.ofFn n` builds
an `R[X]` from `n` coefficients. Adding `X ^ n` gives a monic polynomial; its monicity follows
from `Polynomial.monic_X_pow_add` and `Polynomial.ofFn_degree_lt`.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.ofFn_toFn_eq_of_degree_lt`: Reconstruction below a degree bound, including the
  zero polynomial and the empty coefficient vector.
* `Polynomial.Monic.eq_X_pow_add_ofFn`: Reconstruction of a monic polynomial from its leading
  term and its lower coefficients.
* `Polynomial.coeff_X_pow_add_ofFn_of_lt`: The lower coefficients of the monic construction.
* `Polynomial.natDegree_X_pow_add_ofFn`: Its natural degree over a nontrivial semiring.

These algebraic facts require no topology and apply to arbitrary semirings.
