# Analytic uniqueness from positive real parameters

This file records uniqueness principles for holomorphic functions whose values are known only on
the positive real locus. They are useful for transporting certain identities proved using real
probability measures to their complex analytic continuations.

## Main results

`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_eventuallyEq_ofReal` is one-variable uniqueness from agreement on a real
germ, on a connected continuation domain. `AnalyticOnNhd.eq_of_eqOn_posReal` is uniqueness of
entire functions of one variable from the positive reals. `AnalyticOnNhd.eq_of_eqOn_posReal_pi`
is the corresponding statement for entire functions of finitely many variables. All three
results allow values in any complex normed space; completeness of the target is not needed.
