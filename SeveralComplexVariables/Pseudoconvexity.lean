# Pseudoconvexity

This file relates domains of holomorphy to plurisubharmonic functions and to two geometric
convexity notions.

* **Boundary distance.** On a domain of holomorphy in `Fin n → ℂ`, the negative logarithm of
the supremum-norm distance to the complement is plurisubharmonic. The proof is
[Hörmander][Hormander1973]'s: a
harmonic polynomial majorant of `-log δ` on a circle in a complex line gives, through the
weighted hull-radius bound of Thullen's lemma, the same bound at the center.
* **Pseudoconvexity.** An open set is pseudoconvex if it carries a continuous
  plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Domains of holomorphy are pseudoconvex.
* **Continuity principle.** Along a continuous family of affine analytic discs whose boundary
  circles stay in a pseudoconvex set and whose initial disc lies in the set, every disc lies in
  the set. This is the Kontinuitätssatz for affine discs, proved by the maximum principle for
  plurisubharmonic functions on discs.
* **Hartogs convexity.** In a product `E × ℂ`, a set satisfying the continuity principle
  contains the filled cylinder of every Hartogs cylinder it contains.
* **Kontinuitätssatz.** On a domain of holomorphy in a finite-dimensional complex normed space, the
continuity principle
holds for continuous families of holomorphic discs, not only affine ones: every point of a
holomorphic disc lies in the holomorphic hull of the boundary circle, and Thullen's radius
bound keeps the discs at a fixed distance from the complement.

The boundary-distance result uses the supremum norm on `Fin n → ℂ`. For the whole space,
`Metric.infDist` of the empty complement and `Real.log 0` are both zero, so the function in
that theorem is identically zero. This is a real-valued convention; `boundaryEDistance` instead
takes the value `∞` for an empty complement. Pseudoconvexity and the holomorphic continuity
principle are transported to arbitrary finite-dimensional complex normed spaces; this transport
does not identify their boundary-distance functions.

The converse implications, from pseudoconvexity back to the domain-of-holomorphy property, form
the Levi problem and are outside the present scope.

## Main definitions

* `IsPseudoconvex`: An open set is pseudoconvex if it carries a continuous plurisubharmonic
  exhaustion function: one whose sublevel sets inside the set are compact.
* `SatisfiesContinuityPrinciple`: **Continuity principle for affine analytic discs.** Along a
  continuous family of affine analytic discs whose boundary circles stay in the set and whose
  initial disc lies in the set, every disc of the family lies in the set.
* `SatisfiesHolomorphicContinuityPrinciple`: **Continuity principle for holomorphic discs
  (Kontinuitätssatz).** Along a continuous family of holomorphic discs whose boundary circles stay
  in the set and whose initial disc lies in the set, every disc of the family lies in the set.
* `IsHartogsConvex`: **Hartogs convexity** for cylinder figures: whenever a Hartogs cylinder over an
  open preconnected base, with disc fibers over a nonempty open part of the base, lies in the set,
  so does the filled cylinder.

## Main results

* `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.plurisubharmonicOn_neg_log_infDist`: **Plurisubharmonicity of the boundary
  distance ([Hörmander][Hormander1973] 2.6.5).** On a domain of holomorphy in `Fin n → ℂ`, the
  negative logarithm of the distance to the complement is plurisubharmonic.
* `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.isPseudoconvex_fin`: **Domains of holomorphy in coordinates are
  pseudoconvex.** The exhaustion is the maximum of the negative logarithm of the boundary distance
  and the norm.
* `IsPseudoconvex.satisfiesContinuityPrinciple`: **Pseudoconvex sets satisfy the continuity
  principle ([Fritzsche–Grauert][FritzscheGrauert2002] II.3.1).**
* `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.satisfiesHolomorphicContinuityPrinciple_fin`: **Domains of holomorphy in
  coordinates satisfy the continuity principle for holomorphic discs.** The coordinate-free version
  is `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.satisfiesHolomorphicContinuityPrinciple`.
* `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.isPseudoconvex`: **Domains of holomorphy are pseudoconvex.** The exhaustion
  is transported from the coordinate version `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.isPseudoconvex_fin`.
* `IsDomainOfHolomorphy.satisfiesHolomorphicContinuityPrinciple`: **Domains of holomorphy satisfy
  the continuity principle for holomorphic discs.**
* `SatisfiesContinuityPrinciple.isHartogsConvex`: **The continuity principle implies Hartogs
  convexity ([Fritzsche–Grauert][FritzscheGrauert2002] II.1.5).** The disc fibers are slid along a
  path in the base from the part carrying full discs.
