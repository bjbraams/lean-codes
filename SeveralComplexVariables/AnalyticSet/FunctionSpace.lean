# Restriction across analytic sets of codimension at least two

[Scheidemann][Scheidemann2005]'s second Riemann theorem is stated as an isomorphism of
holomorphic algebras. The forward map below is restriction. Injectivity uses density;
surjectivity uses the proved second Riemann extension theorem. Disconnected and empty domains
are allowed. No assertion about continuity of the inverse is needed for this algebraic
formulation.

## Main results

`analyticSetRestrictionAlgEquiv` is [Scheidemann][Scheidemann2005]'s second Riemann theorem as
an isomorphism of holomorphic algebras across an analytic set of slice codimension at least two.
`analyticSetRestrictionAlgEquiv_apply` is restriction of representatives.
