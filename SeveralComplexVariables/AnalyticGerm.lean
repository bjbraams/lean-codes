# The local ring of analytic germs

An analytic germ is a Mathlib `Filter.Germ` with a representative analytic at the base point.
Equality is agreement on a neighborhood, rather than equality just at the base point. The scalar
field `𝕜` is an explicit argument, `AnalyticGerm 𝕜 x`, and may be any nontrivially normed field:
the scalar germs form a `𝕜`-algebra, evaluation detects its units, identifies its unique maximal
ideal with the germs vanishing at the base point, and identifies the quotient with `𝕜`, and
analytic maps act contravariantly by `𝕜`-algebra homomorphisms. Over `ℝ` or `ℂ` the germs form an
integral domain, by the identity principle on connected balls. The rest of the germ theory in this
library is developed for `𝕜 = ℂ`.

The motivating references are [Suwa][Suwa2024] (2024), Section 1.4, Propositions 1.5--1.7, and
[Jakóbczak–Jarnicki][JakobczakJarnicki2021] (2021), Section 1.8. We use `AnalyticAt` for
convergent power series; on finite-dimensional complex domains this agrees with the project's
holomorphic convention. The construction works on arbitrary normed spaces, including the zero
space. Analytic Weierstrass division and preparation are not asserted here.

## Main definitions

* `analyticGermSubring`: The subring of germs admitting a representative analytic at the base point.
* `AnalyticGerm`: Scalar analytic germs at `x`, with the ring operations inherited from Mathlib
  germs.
* `ofAnalyticAt`: The germ of a function analytic at the base point.
* `eval`: Evaluation of an analytic germ at its base point, as a ring homomorphism.
* `const`: Constant functions define a ring homomorphism into analytic germs.
* `evalAlgHom`: Evaluation also preserves the `𝕜`-algebra structure.
* `pullback`: Composition with an analytic map pulls scalar germs back as a `𝕜`-algebra
  homomorphism.
* `pullbackOfEq`: Pullback along a map whose value at the source point is only known up to a stated
  equation, letting the target germ's base point be phrased as any value equal to `f x`.
* `quotientKerEvalEquiv`: Quotienting analytic germs by the evaluation kernel gives the scalar
  field.
* `quotientMaximalIdealEquiv`: The quotient by the unique maximal ideal is canonically the scalar
  field.
* `equivScalarOfSubsingleton`: Analytic germs on a zero-dimensional domain form exactly the scalar
  field.

## Main results

* `isUnit_iff`: An analytic germ is invertible exactly when its value at the base point is nonzero.
* `maximalIdeal_eq_ker_eval`: Evaluation has the unique maximal ideal as its kernel.
* `pullback_comp`: Pullbacks compose in the reverse order to their analytic maps.
* `eval_surjective`: Evaluation onto the scalar field is surjective.
