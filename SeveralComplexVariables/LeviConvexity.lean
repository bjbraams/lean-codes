# Levi convex boundaries

A local `C²` defining function for an open set `U` at a boundary point `p` is a `C²` function
`ρ` on an open neighborhood `V` of `p`, vanishing at `p`, with nonzero derivative at `p`, such
that `U ∩ V` is the set where `ρ` is negative. The complex tangent space at `p` is the kernel of
the complex-linear part of the derivative of `ρ`. The set `U` satisfies the Levi condition at
`p` if the Levi form of every local defining function is positive semidefinite on the complex
tangent space; it is Levi pseudoconvex if this holds at every boundary point. Quantifying over
all defining functions avoids the lemma that two defining functions differ by a positive factor.

This file proves that convex open sets are Levi pseudoconvex: along a real tangent line the
defining function vanishes to first order at `p`, so a negative second derivative would put two
symmetric points of the line into `U` and, by convexity, the boundary point itself.

It also provides the complex-linear part `complexPart ℓ` of a real functional `ℓ`, with `ℓ (ζ •
c) = Re (ζ * complexPart ℓ c)`, and the decomposition of a symmetric real bilinear form along a
complex line into a Hermitian part, the Levi form, and the real part of a complex quadratic
term. Both are used for the Levi polynomial in `LeviConvexity.Necessity`.

## Main definitions

* `complexPart`: The complex-linear part of a real functional: `ℓ c - I * ℓ (I • c)`.
* `IsLocalDefiningFunction`: A local `C²` defining function for `U` at `p` on the open neighborhood
  `V`: `ρ p = 0`, the real derivative of `ρ` at `p` is nonzero, and `U ∩ V` is the negative sublevel
  set of `ρ` in `V`.
* `HasC2Boundary`: A set has `C²` boundary if every boundary point has a local defining function.
* `IsComplexTangent`: The complex tangent space of the level set of `ρ` at `p`: the kernel of the
  complex-linear part of the derivative.
* `IsLeviPseudoconvexAt`: The Levi condition at a boundary point: the Levi form of every local
  defining function is positive semidefinite on the complex tangent space.
* `IsLeviPseudoconvex`: Levi pseudoconvexity: the Levi condition at every boundary point.

## Main results

* `bilinear_smul_smul_eq`: **Quadratic decomposition along a complex line.** For a symmetric real
  bilinear form `B`, `B (ζ • w) (ζ • w) / 2` is `‖ζ‖ ^ 2` times the Hermitian part `(B w w + B (I •
  w) (I • w)) / 4` plus the real part of `ζ ^ 2` times the complex quadratic coefficient `(B w w - B
  (I • w) (I • w)) / 4 - I / 2 * B w (I • w)`.
* `Convex.isLeviPseudoconvex`: **Convex open sets are Levi pseudoconvex** ([Range][Range1986], Lemma
  2.10).
