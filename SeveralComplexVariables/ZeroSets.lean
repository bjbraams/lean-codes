# Zero sets in several complex variables

The identity-principle consequences in `ZeroSets.Basic` and the local zero-set comparison
theorems in `ZeroSets.Local` are re-exported here. Isolated scalar zeros are excluded by the
proved puncture-removal theorem applied to the reciprocal.

Reference: [Jakóbczak–Jarnicki][JakobczakJarnicki2021] (2021), Corollary 2.1.3.

## Main results

* `frequently_zero_punctured_of_analyticAt`: A scalar holomorphic function in complex dimension at
  least two cannot have an isolated zero.

/-- A scalar holomorphic function in complex dimension at least two cannot have an isolated zero.
See [Jakóbczak–Jarnicki][JakobczakJarnicki2021] Corollary 2.1.3. Applying Hartogs extension to
the reciprocal would contradict an isolated zero. The scalar target and dimension restriction
are essential: vector-valued maps and functions of one variable can have isolated zeros. -/
