# Polynomial relations on the full slit domain

The polynomial coefficients of an associated relation are entire in the nodes.
Consequently the same coefficients that work on right-half-plane nodes work on
the whole product slit plane. This extends Carlson's relation 8.4-1 and Theorem
8.4-3 without changing their coefficients or introducing parameter exceptions.

The existential coefficients of Theorem 8.4-3 are still chosen for fixed exponent
and Dirichlet parameters; no polynomial or analytic dependence of those witnesses
on the parameters is claimed.

/-- Carlson's Theorem 8.4-3 for all complex parameters and slit-plane nodes.
Nontriviality is polynomial nontriviality, not a pointwise assertion. The empty
index type is included through the existing entire-parameter theorem. -/
