# Polynomial coefficients in parameters and nodes

The coefficients in Carlson's homogeneity recurrence are represented by genuine
multivariate polynomials, not by witnesses chosen for fixed parameters. The
coordinates are `none` for `a`, `some (inl i)` for `bᵢ`, and `some (inr i)` for `zᵢ`.
The R-functions have exponents `-a-n`. Formal differentiation in `none` therefore
provides the correction coefficients needed for the corresponding L-recurrence.

This constructs a universal homogeneity recurrence. It does not yet construct
universal coefficient witnesses for arbitrary lists of associated shifts.
