# Single-variable complex analysis

General complex analysis supporting contour representations and analytic continuation.
The development extends Mathlib's complex-analysis infrastructure, with Banach-valued targets
where appropriate. Complex-specific declarations use `Complex`; extensions of existing APIs
retain their usual namespaces. There is no dependency on application or SCV function theory.
General support is imported from the independent `Analysis` and `Topology` libraries.
Divided differences and repeated integrals also use the general `StdSimplexMeasure` foundations.

* `HalfPlane`, `Pow`: right-half-plane geometry, sector roots, finite-family containing disks,
  and multiplication and holomorphy of principal powers.
* `BranchLog`: holomorphic logarithms and roots on simply connected open sets, with
  normalization and uniqueness of logarithm branches.
* `BranchLog.Homotopy`: continuous logarithm lifts of path homotopies in the punctured plane
  and invariance of the terminal branch value under continuous deformation.
* `ExteriorPath`, `ExteriorPath.Integral`: compactified paths escaping to infinity,
  their Jacobians, and Banach-valued endpoint formulas for exact exterior integrals.
* `Analysis.Integral.CurveIntegral`: the general endpoint formulas for exact one-forms,
  imported by the complex curve-integral theory.
* `HasPrimitives`: Banach-valued primitives on simply connected open domains, local-to-global
  exactness, normalization, uniqueness, and the global primitive consequence of Morera's theorem.
* `HasPrimitives.Pullback`: continuous potentials after pullback along maps from simply
  connected spaces, with local primitive increments computing image-path integrals.
* `CauchyIntegral`: path independence, Cauchy's theorem on simply connected open sets, and
  integration of logarithmic derivatives.
* `CauchyFormula`: Banach-valued Cauchy formulas on simply connected open sets, with an explicit
  scalar kernel integral.
* `LogDerivIntegral`, `CurveIndex`: the exponential endpoint identity, integer-valued index
  for closed C¹ curves avoiding the pole, index laws, and the index-weighted Cauchy formula.
* `CurveIndex.Continuity`: continuity and local constancy away from the curve, constancy on
  connected components, and vanishing on unbounded components of the complement.
* `Integral.Homotopy`, `CurveIndex.Homotopy`: Cauchy's theorem under `C²` path homotopies
  on arbitrary open domains; the curve index also respects continuous based homotopies of `C¹`
  loops.
* `Integral.ContinuousHomotopy`: Cauchy's theorem under continuous homotopies, including moving
  endpoints, and passage to limits of finite contours when endpoint-track integrals vanish.
* `Integral.CirclePath`: smooth circles as paths and agreement of curve and circle integrals;
  `CurveIndex` evaluates the index inside and outside a circle.
* `Integral.Map`, `UnivalentDisk`: holomorphic changes of variables, embedded image-circle
  boundaries, two-component separation, index normalization, Banach-valued Cauchy formulas,
  and relatively compact exhaustions for domains parametrized by injective holomorphic disk maps.
* `PolygonIntegral`: integration over oriented polygon edges and polygonal Cauchy's theorem.
* `CauchyDerivatives`, `CauchyEstimates`, `CauchySeries`: circle derivative formulas, compact
  derivative bounds, geometric Taylor-coefficient majorants, and Cauchy-series estimates.
* `LaurentSeries`: Banach-valued coefficients and expansions, annular formulas, and geometry.
* `Residue`, `Residue.LogDeriv`: residues at isolated singularities, pole computations,
  and logarithmic-derivative residues equal to meromorphic orders.
* `ArgumentPrinciple`, `Rouche`, `Hurwitz`: disk zero counting with multiplicities,
  stability under perturbation, and zero-free or injective limits of holomorphic functions.
* `FunctionSpace`, `Montel`, `Vitali`: compact-open holomorphic spaces, compactness and
  convergent subsequences under compact-local bounds, and Vitali convergence from an
  interior accumulation point, using shared `Analysis` foundations without SCV imports.
* `EssentialSingularity`: analytic extension of bounded punctured germs, the isolated
  singularity alternatives, and Casorati–Weierstrass density near essential singularities.
* `Subharmonic`: planar submean and maximum principles, majorants, convex examples, and the
  Laplacian criterion.
* `CauchyPompeiu`, `CauchyTransform`: planar integral identities and transforms with parameters.
* `RemovableSingularity`, `Injective`, `ZeroPersistence`: planar removal, injectivity, and zeros.
* `ParametricIntegral`, `RealUniqueness`, `LocallyUniform`, `Integral.Circle`: one-variable
  integration, uniqueness, convergence, and circle helpers.
* `HolomorphicIntegral`: holomorphy of parametric interval integrals with jointly continuous
  integrands, Fubini for interval integrals, and joint continuity of the divided slope.
* `Cycle`, `Cycle.Cauchy`, `Cycle.Residue`, `Cycle.ArgumentPrinciple`: cycles as finite
  families of closed `C¹` curves, their integrals and indices, and the homology forms of
  Cauchy's theorem and formula (Dixon's proof), of the residue theorem, and of the argument
  principle for cycles whose index vanishes outside the domain.
* `Cycle.Parallelogram`: the boundary of a parallelogram as a single `C^∞` closed curve
  (gluing the four edges with `Real.smoothTransition`, flat at the corners), with its index
  shown to vanish outside the closed parallelogram by a convexity-coning nullhomotopy; the
  index equal to `1` on the open interior is not established.
* `Runge.Kernel`, `Runge.Cutoff`, `Runge.Basic`, `Runge.PolePushing`, `Runge.Theorem`:
  Runge's approximation theorem, through the Cauchy–Pompeiu representation with a smooth
  cutoff, uniform approximation of Cauchy-type integrals by finite pole sums, and pole pushing
  in the components of the complement; polynomial approximation when the complement is
  connected.
* `Runge.OpenSet`, `MittagLeffler`: Runge's theorem on open sets through hole-free compact
  exhaustions, with locally uniformly convergent sequences of approximants, and the
  Mittag-Leffler theorem on arbitrary open sets.
* `InfiniteProduct`, `WeierstrassFactor`, `WeierstrassProduct`: holomorphy, zeros, and orders of
  locally uniformly convergent infinite products, the elementary factors with their uniform
  estimate, the Weierstrass product with prescribed zeros, and the factorization of entire
  functions.
* `DiscMobius`, `HolomorphicInverse`, `RiemannMapping`, `DiscAutomorphism`, `Cayley`: disc
  Möbius transformations, holomorphic inverses of injective holomorphic maps, the Riemann
  mapping theorem by the extremal argument, the classification of disc and half-plane
  automorphisms, and uniqueness of the normalized Riemann map.
* `Harnack`, `DirichletDisc`: Poisson kernel bounds and Harnack's inequality, the Poisson
  integral of continuous boundary data as the solution of the Dirichlet problem on a disc,
  harmonic functions as subharmonic functions, and uniqueness by the maximum principle.
* `LocalMapping`, `ResidueAtInfinity`: the local `m`-to-one mapping theorem by Rouché, the
  residue at infinity with the inversion change of variables, and the total residue theorem.
* `AnalyticContinuation`, `NaturalBoundary`: function elements along a path, uniqueness of
  analytic continuation by the clopen argument, and the lacunary series `∑ z ^ (2 ^ n)` with
  the unit circle as natural boundary.
* `CanonicalProduct`, `CanonicalProduct.Bounds`, `CanonicalProduct.GoodRadii`, `FiniteOrder`,
  `Hadamard`: canonical products of finite genus over a countable index type with their
  zeros, lower bounds off small discs around the zeros and good radii; entire functions of
  finite order, Jensen's zero-counting bound and the summability of inverse powers of the
  zeros; Hadamard's factorization theorem.
* `Blaschke`: Blaschke factors and products on the disc with their zeros and the bound by
  one, the Blaschke condition for the zeros of bounded holomorphic functions from Jensen's
  formula, and the resulting uniqueness theorem.
* `RieszFactorization`: the multiplicity-weighted Blaschke condition, division by a
  matching-order function on the disc, and the Riesz factorization theorem `f = z ^ m * B * g`
  with `B` the Blaschke product of the zeros of `f` and `g` holomorphic and nonvanishing.
* `SchwarzPick`: the Schwarz–Pick lemma in distance and derivative form, contracting the
  pseudo-hyperbolic distance and the hyperbolic metric of the disc.
* `ThreeCircles`: Hadamard's three-circle theorem, that the maximum modulus of a nonvanishing
  holomorphic function on an annulus is a log-convex function of the radius, by the maximum
  principle for the harmonic function `log ‖f‖ - a log ‖z‖`.
* `GreenFunction`: existence and nonnegativity of the Green function of a bounded open set with
  the exterior disc property, as the harmonic compensator for the logarithmic singularity at a
  pole.
* `KoebeDistortion`: the pre-Schwarzian bound for injective holomorphic maps of the disc, by
  Bieberbach's theorem applied to the Koebe transform at each point.
* `KoebeGrowth`: the Koebe distortion theorem (both bounds on `‖f' z‖`) and the growth theorem's
  upper bound on `‖f z‖`, by integrating the pre-Schwarzian bound along a ray through a
  holomorphic logarithm of `f'`; the growth theorem's lower bound is not derived.
* `MobiusGeometry`: invariance of the cross ratio under Möbius transformations, and generalized
  circles (circles and lines) mapping to generalized circles, by decomposing a Möbius map into
  translations, scalings, and inversion.
* `EllipticLiouville`: Liouville's first theorem for elliptic functions, that an entire
  function doubly periodic with respect to a lattice (`PeriodPair`) is constant, by showing
  it is bounded on the compact fundamental parallelogram and applying the classical Liouville
  theorem for bounded entire functions.
* `HarmonicLimit`, `Perron`, `Perron.Barrier`: locally uniform limits of harmonic functions
  are harmonic, Harnack's principle for monotone sequences, the maximum principle for
  subharmonic functions with boundary upper limits, Perron's method (the upper envelope of
  the Perron family is harmonic), barriers and the boundary behaviour of the Perron
  solution, the exterior disc criterion, and the solution of the Dirichlet problem on
  bounded open sets with the exterior disc property.
* `Parseval`, `DiscCauchyTransform`, `AreaTheorem`, `Koebe`: Cauchy's coefficient formula and
  Parseval's identity for Taylor coefficients on circles with Gutzmer's inequality, the Cauchy
  transform of a disc by polar coordinates, the index-area identity and Gronwall's area theorem
  for the class `Σ`, Bieberbach's bound `‖a₂‖ ≤ 2` and the Koebe one-quarter theorem.

The index of merely continuous closed curves and the Jordan curve theorem remain open. General
Jordan separation and normalization beyond these analytic disk contours remain open. The
Riemann mapping theorem now supplies an injective holomorphic disk parametrization of every
simply connected proper planar domain; transporting contours through it is not yet done.
