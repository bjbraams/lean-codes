# Carlson project module structure

The project has five mathematical layers. Dependencies run from
simplex-independent support (`Pochhammer`, `SeveralComplexVariables`) and
simplex geometry/integration (`StdSimplexMeasure`) through `Dirichlet` to
`Carlson`. The support libraries do not import the simplex or either
application layer, and Dirichlet theory does not import Carlson functions.

The root modules and the topic umbrellas below are convenient entry points.

## Pochhammer support modules

To be described.

## Several complex variables support modules

To be described.

## Simplex foundation modules

### `StdSimplexMeasure.PositiveSimplex`

Contains modules `Basic`, `SumIntegral`, `Aggregation`.

Geometric operations. Solid-simplex geometry and volume; sum-coordinate integration; aggregation.

### `StdSimplexMeasure.Measure`

Contains modules `Basic`, `Aggregation`.

Ambient coordinate measure and invariance; aggregation pushforward density.

`stdSimplexMeasure` is a measure on the **entire sum-one affine hyperplane**, not a measure
supported only on the simplex.
Intrinsic simplex measure is its restriction transported through the coordinate
homeomorphism.

### `StdSimplexMeasure.Integral`

Contains modules `Basic`, `Slicing`, `Monomial`, `Aggregation`.

Coordinate integral API; slicing/Fubini; polynomial integration; aggregation.

Ambient smooth neighborhoods and derivatives remain in the coordinate vector
space.

## Dirichlet theory modules

### `Dirichlet.Beta.Complex.Basic`

Contains module `Integral`.

Complex multivariate beta. Gamma quotient and parameter identities.
Simplex integral evaluation.

### `Dirichlet.Real`

Real probability results. `Dirichlet.Real.Moments` → `Real.Aggregation` → `Real.Marginals`.
Probability statements about moments, aggregation, and beta marginals are downstream of the real distribution.

### `Dirichlet.Complex`

Complex Dirichlet results.
Analytic dependence and
continuation are downstream of the native complex integrals.

### `Dirichlet.Bridge`

Compatibility between Real and Complex results.
The real probability distribution and complex integral interface share analytic
foundations; neither interface imports the other.

### Dirichlet layers

| Module | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `StdSimplexMeasure.Interior` | Positive-coordinate simplex interior, measurability, permutation invariance, and almost-everywhere membership |
| `Dirichlet.Integral.Real` | Nonnegative and real monomial integrals, beta normalization, and real integrability |
| `Dirichlet.Integral.Complex` | Absolutely convergent complex monomial integrals and logarithmic majorants |
| `Dirichlet.Complex.Analytic` | Parameter analyticity on the absolute-convergence domain |
| `Dirichlet.Transform` | Continuation beyond the convergence domain for suitable test functions |

| Topic | Modules |
| --- | --- |
| Native averages | `Dirichlet.Average.Basic`: regularized and ordinary definitions together |
| Associated average analysis | `Dirichlet.Average.Associated.Relations` → `Deriv` → `Analytic` |
| Holomorphic kernels and joint continuation | `Dirichlet.Complex.Parametric` → `Dirichlet.Transform.Parametric` → `Dirichlet.Average.JointContinuation`: Carlson 6.3-6 on general convex open node domains; the general Jordan-curve representation remains separate |
| Continued Cauchy representations | `Dirichlet.Average.ResolventContinuation` and `CauchyContinuation`, using `SeveralComplexVariables.ContourIntegral`: entire-parameter resolvents and circle representations |
| Continuation on nonconvex domains | `Dirichlet.Average.HolomorphicDomain`: domain-aware characterization, uniqueness, and increasing-domain gluing; local Jordan-domain existence and planar exhaustion remain open |
| Hull-admissible integral domains | `Dirichlet.Average.IntegralDomain`: open node-domain geometry, joint continuation on the native node domain, and recognition of a given continuation on star-convex scalar domains |

`Dirichlet.Beta.Complex`, `Dirichlet.Moments`, and
`Dirichlet.Average.Associated` re-export their topic modules.
`Dirichlet.Real` remains the basic distribution interface, not an umbrella
over its probability corollaries.

Analytic continuation remains downstream of native complex integration.
The general affine-form convex-hull characterization belongs in
`Dirichlet.Average.Kernel`, not in the T-function application.

## Carlson functions modules

### R-function analytic construction

`Carlson.R.SingleIntegral` is an umbrella over four steps:

1. `SingleIntegral.Series`: unit-interval definition and near-one series.
2. `SingleIntegral.UnitInterval`: kernel analysis and native representation.
3. `SingleIntegral.Continuation`: unit-interval representation with continued
   Dirichlet parameters.
4. `SingleIntegral.PositiveRay`: positive-ray substitution and representations.

`SlitContinuation` uses the continued unit-interval construction; ray-kernel
arguments use `PositiveRay`. Euler transformation no longer imports the
declaration-free `Contour` placeholder. The contour formula is still a
separate mathematical task.

The slit-domain API separates `SlitRelations` (parameter-shift identities),
`SlitDeriv` (node derivatives and differential identities), and
`EulerPoisson` (the second-order system).

The three R interfaces remain distinct: native simplex integrals,
right-half-plane parameter continuation, and slit-node continuation.
`R.SlitIntegral` and `L.SlitIntegral` prove native-integral agreement when the
whole node convex hull stays in the slit plane; individual slit-plane nodes
alone are insufficient. `R.SlitIntegral` also specializes the continued circle
representation to R. Ordinary normalization still uses the total-parameter
Gamma factor; Lean's totalized values at Gamma poles are not assertions of
finite ordinary-function values.

### Recurrences and associated dependence

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Carlson.Associated.LinearDependence` | Generic denominator-clearing and finite-dimensional dependence; no Carlson or Dirichlet imports |
| `Carlson.Associated.Shift` | Shift indices and rational-coefficient data |
| `Carlson.R.Recurrence.Coefficients` | Symmetric-polynomial recurrence coefficients, independently of R-functions |
| `Carlson.R.AssociatedRecurrence` | Native homogeneity recurrence |
| `Carlson.R.Associated.ExponentReduction` | Polynomial and rational reduction to a finite exponent window |
| `Carlson.R.AssociatedDependence` | Parameter reduction and fixed-parameter dependence theorem |
| `Carlson.R.SlitRecurrence` | Transport of polynomial relations and the homogeneity recurrence to slit nodes |
| `Carlson.R.SlitAssociated` | Fixed-parameter associated dependence on the slit domain |
| `Carlson.R.Recurrence.JointCoefficients` | Joint parameter/node coefficient polynomials and formal derivatives |
| `Carlson.R.JointRecurrence` | Universal R homogeneity identity using those polynomials |

The joint coefficient construction does not depend on the fixed-parameter
existential dependence theorem. This leaves a clean base for the still-open
extension of arbitrary associated-shift dependence to joint polynomial
coefficients, and hence for differentiating such identities to obtain
L-relations. Reorganization itself does not establish that extension.

Scalar Gamma-regularity and reciprocal-Gamma estimates live in
`Pochhammer.Gamma`.

### Two-variable and S-function theory

`Carlson.TwoVariable.Basic` contains only the two-coordinate and swap API.
Function abbreviations have their own `R.Basic`, `RPolynomial.Basic`, and
`S.Basic` modules.

The two-variable associated and inversion identities have parallel
`R.Associated` / `L.Associated` and `R.Inversion` / `L.Inversion` modules.
The L modules depend on the R modules, not conversely.
`TwoVariable.Associated` and `TwoVariable.Inversion` re-export both sides.

`TwoVariable.Quadratic` re-exports `Quadratic.Geometry`,
`Quadratic.Polynomial`, and `Quadratic.Integral`. Parameter continuation,
the finer equal-parameter normalization, and differentiated L-transformations
remain in `QuadraticContinuation`, `EqualParameter`, and `LQuadratic`.
`QuadraticSlit` extends the raw regularized R identities to all square-root
variables with positive real parts, without requiring their squared or
mean-square nodes to have positive real parts. The finer equal-parameter
and L interfaces retain their original node domains and normalization.

`Carlson.S` re-exports `S.Basic`, `S.Series`, `S.Analytic`, `S.Deriv`,
and `S.Properties`: native definitions, series continuation, joint analysis,
continued node derivatives, and functional identities.
