# Compact exhaustions of open subsets

## Main results

* `IsOpen.exists_compact_exhaustion`: An open subset of a locally compact, second-countable
  topological space has an increasing sequence of compact subsets containing every compact
  subset of the open set in some term. The construction uses `CompactExhaustion.choice` on
  the open subtype and maps its terms into the ambient space.

In particular, the result applies to open subsets of proper metric spaces. No norm, group
structure, or nonemptiness assumption is needed.
