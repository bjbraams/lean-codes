# Elementary facts on scalar actions and continuous linear functionals

## Main results

* `Complex.smul_eq_re_smul_add_im_smul`: A complex scalar acts on a vector of a complex module
  through its real and imaginary parts.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_apply_eq_one_of_ne_zero`: A nonzero continuous linear functional
  attains the value `1` on a nonzero vector.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_pos_smul_eq_of_neg_imp_nonpos`: Inclusion of negative half-spaces
  forces two nonzero real continuous linear functionals to be positively proportional.
