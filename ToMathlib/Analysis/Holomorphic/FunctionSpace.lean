# Shared spaces of holomorphic maps

Holomorphic maps on an open subset of a complex normed space form a submodule of continuous
maps, with the induced compact-open topology and uniformity. This file defines the space,
restriction and evaluation, and identifies convergence with locally uniform convergence.
It depends only on Mathlib. Closedness under limits is supplied separately by the one-variable
and several-variable theories. Coordinate differentiation belongs to the latter.

The extension by zero is used only to express analyticity on the open domain; no regularity
at its boundary is asserted.

## Main results

* `Complex.HolomorphicMap`: Holomorphic maps on an open domain, with the induced compact-open
  topology and uniformity.
* `Complex.holomorphicMap_tendsto_iff`: The inherited topology on holomorphic maps is precisely
  locally uniform convergence.
* `Complex.continuous_holomorphicMap_eval`: Evaluation at a point is continuous in the
  compact-open topology.
* `Complex.holomorphicRestrict`: Restriction to a smaller open domain preserves holomorphy.
* `Complex.continuous_holomorphicRestrict`: Restriction is continuous for the compact-open
  topology.
