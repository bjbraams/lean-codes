# Connectedness of shells and exteriors of balls

In a real normed space of dimension at least two, spherical shells and exteriors of closed balls
centered at the origin are preconnected. The proofs are radial: a shell is the image of the product
of an interval and the unit sphere.

## Main results

* `isPreconnected_ball_diff_closedBall_zero`: A shell in a real normed space of dimension at least
  two is preconnected.
* `isPreconnected_compl_closedBall_zero`: The exterior of a closed norm ball is preconnected in
  real dimension at least two.
